This estimator is reviewed briefly in an empirical Bayes context. Stein's rule and its generalizations are then applied to predict baseball averages, to estimate toxomosis prevalence rates, and to estimate the exact size of Pearson's chi-square test with results from a computer simulation. In each of these examples, the mean square error of these rules is less than half that of the sample mean.},

     abstract = {Many studies comparing new treatments to standard treatments consist of parallel randomized experiments. In the example considered here, randomized experiments were conducted in eight schools to determine the effectiveness of special coaching programs for the SAT. The purpose here is to illustrate Bayesian and empirical Bayesian techniques that can be used to help summarize the evidence in such data about differences among treatments, thereby obtaining improved estimates of the treatment effect in each experiment, including the one having the largest observed effect. Three main tools are illustrated: 1) graphical techniques for displaying sensitivity within an empirical Bayes framework, 2) simple simulation techniques for generating Bayesian posterior distributions of individual effects and the largest effect, and 3) methods for monitoring the adequacy of the Bayesian model specification by simulating the posterior predictive distribution in hypothetical replications of the same treatments in the same eight schools.},

     abstract = {We consider two-stage models of the kind used in parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) methodology, calling them conditionally independent hierarchical models. We suppose that there are k "units," which may be experimental subjects, cities, study centers, etcetera. At the first stage, the observation vectors Yi for units i = 1,...,k are independently distributed with densities p(yi∣θi), or more generally, p(yi∣θi, λ). At the second stage, the unit-specific parameter vectors θi are iid with densities p(θi∣λ). The PEB approach proceeds by regarding the second-stage distribution as a prior and noting that, if λ were known, inference about θ could be based on its posterior. Since λ is not known, the simplest PEB methods estimate the parameter λ by maximum likelihood or some variant, and then treat λ as if it were known to be equal to this estimate. Although this procedure is sometimes satisfactory, a well-known defect is that it neglects the uncertainty due to the estimation of λ. In this article we suggest that approximate Bayesian inference can provide simple and manageable solutions to this problem. In Bayesian inferences, a prior density π(·) on λ is introduced, the posterior p(λ∣y) is calculated, and the posterior density of θi is then equal to the expectation, with respect to p(λ∣y), of the conditional posterior p(θi∣ yi, λ). From the Bayesian point of view, the PEB estimate is of interest because it is a first-order approximation to the posterior mean [having an error of order O(k-1)]. Letting Eλ and Vλ denote the expectation and variance with respect to p(λ∣y), we may write the posterior variance of θi as V(θi∣y) = Eλ{V(θi∣ yi, λ)} + Vλ{E(θi∣ yi, λ)}. The conditional posterior variance $V(\theta_i\mid y_i, \hat\lambda)$ , where $\hat\lambda$ is the maximum likelihood estimator, approximates only the first term. When we include an approximation to the second term we obtain a first-order approximation to the posterior variance itself. In many examples, this elementary method, incorporating approximations to both terms, will substantially account for the estimation of λ. We briefly consider second-order approximations, noting that the work of Deely and Lindley (1981) may be extended using expansions derived by Lindley (1980), Mosteller and Wallace (1964), Tierney and Kadane (1986), and Tierney, Kass, and Kadane (1989). We suggest that second-order approximations provide rough and, often, easily computed assessments of accuracy of first-order approximations. Although we confine our data-analytical examples to simple models, we believe the methods will be useful in general settings. An important area of application is longitudinal data analysis.},

     abstract = {The Poisson model and analyses here feature nonexchangeable gamma distributions (although exchangeable following a scale transformation) for individual parameters, with standard deviations proportional to means. A relatively uninformative prior distribution for the shrinkage values eliminates the ill behavior of maximum likelihood estimators of the variance components. When tested in simulation studies, the resulting procedure provides better coverage probabilities and smaller risk than several other published rules, and thus works well from Bayesian and frequentist perspectives alike. The computations provide fast, accurate density approximations to individual parameters and to structural regression coefficients. The computer program is publicly available through Statlib.},

Fitting this model requires assessing the Level-2 variance A ≡ Var(θ i ) to estimate shrinkages B i ≡ V i /(V i + A) toward a (possibly estimated) subspace, with B i as the target because the conditional means and variances of θ i depend linearly on B i , not on A. Adjustment for density maximization, ADM, can do the fitting for any smooth prior on A. Like the MLE, ADM bases inferences on two derivatives, but ADM can approximate with any Pearson family, with Beta distributions being appropriate because shrinkage factors satisfy 0 ≤ B i ≤ 1. Our emphasis is on frequency properties, which leads to adopting a uniform prior on A ≥ 0, which then puts Stein's harmonic prior (SHP) on the k random effects. It is known for the "equal variances case" V 1 = ··· = V k that formal Bayes procedures for this prior produce admissible minimax estimates of the random effects, and that the posterior variances are large enough to provide confidence intervals that meet their nominal coverages. Similar results are seen to hold for our approximating "ADM-SHP" procedure for equal variances and also for the unequal variances situations checked here. For shrinkage coefficient estimation, the ADM-SHP procedure allows an alternative frequency interpretation. Writing L(A) as the likelihood of B i with i fixed, ADM-SHP estimates B i as B̂ i = V i /(V i + Â) with Â ≡ argmax(A * L(A)). This justifies the term "adjustment for likelihood maximization," ALM.},
